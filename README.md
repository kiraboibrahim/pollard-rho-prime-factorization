# Pollard Rho Prime Factorization

A flask web application for prime factorizing integers. The essence of this project is the problem the web application 
is addressing which is prime factorization. A modular approach has been followed to separate the presentation logic
from the business logic

The application uses the Pollard Rho algorithm for prime factorization. The implementation of the Pollard Rho algorithm 
is in the file 'prime_factorization.py' and the web application is contained in the 'app.py' file.

## Running the application

Preferably, creating a virtual environment before installing the requirements would be better.

`pip install -r requiremnts.txt`
`flask run`
